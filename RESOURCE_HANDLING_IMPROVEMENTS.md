# Resource Handling Improvements

## Problem
The chat service was previously injecting "Resource temporarily unavailable" messages into system prompts when MCP resources failed to load. This caused the LLM to acknowledge technical issues that it couldn't help with, creating a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Graceful Degradation Pattern
- **Before**: Failed resources were included in system prompts with error messages
- **After**: Only successfully loaded resources are included in system prompts

### 2. New Methods Added

#### `_get_available_resources()`
- Proactively checks which resources can be successfully loaded
- Returns only resources with actual content
- Logs unavailable resources for debugging but excludes them from user-facing content
- Implements fail-fast principle by detecting errors early

#### `_update_resource_catalog_on_availability()`
- Updates the resource catalog to only include working resources
- Implements circuit-breaker-like pattern for resource management
- Periodically checks if previously failed resources have become available

### 3. Updated System Prompt Generation
- `_make_system_prompt()` now only includes verified available resources
- No more "Resource temporarily unavailable" messages in system prompts
- Clean separation between technical errors and user experience

## Best Practices Applied

### From Industry Research:
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures by stopping attempts to access failing resources
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even when some components fail
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Technical errors don't pollute user-facing content
4. **Fail-Fast Principle**: Detect and handle errors early rather than propagating them

### From MCP Platform Guidelines:
- Pydantic for data validation and type safety
- Comprehensive type hints on all methods
- Fail-fast error handling with proper logging
- Modern Python syntax (union types with `|`)

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: LLM no longer mentions technical issues it can't resolve
2. **Cleaner System Prompts**: Only working resources are included
3. **Improved Reliability**: Resource failures don't cascade to user interactions
4. **Better Debugging**: Clear logging of resource availability without user impact
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add more sophisticated resource management later

## Example Before/After

### Before:
```
System Prompt:
You are a helpful assistant...

**Available Resources:**
**resource://desktop-files**: Resource temporarily unavailable
**resource://docs-index**: Resource temporarily unavailable
```

LLM Response: "Hello! It seems like I'm experiencing some technical hiccups with accessing files..."

### After:
```
System Prompt:
You are a helpful assistant...

[No resource section included since none are available]
```

LLM Response: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

## Future Enhancements

1. **Resource Health Monitoring**: Track resource uptime and availability metrics
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for temporarily failed resources
3. **Resource Caching**: Cache successfully loaded resource content
4. **Configuration Options**: Allow users to configure resource handling behavior
