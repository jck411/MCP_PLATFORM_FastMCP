Calculate powers\n4. Perform division\n5. Do subtraction\n\nJust let me know what you'd like to calculate and I'll help you out with a bit of mathematical fun! ðŸ˜Š", "tool_calls": [], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 820, "completion_tokens": 116, "total_tokens": 936}, "provider": "openai", "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "stop_reason": null, "token_count": 106, "created_at": "2025-07-26T20:44:02.632825", "extra": {"user_request_id": "22e77a48-b832-4b7a-8873-97db69ac1ac1"}, "raw": null}

But that wasn't enough excitement for them.Then they decided to multiply their friendship, and created 6! But the most magical moment was when 2 realized it could climb to 3's power, becoming 8! \n\nThe moral of the story? Even simple numbers can create amazing results when they work together!
